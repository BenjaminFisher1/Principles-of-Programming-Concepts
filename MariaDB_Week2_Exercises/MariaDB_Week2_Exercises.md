### Setup
Again, I'm completing this assignment on the Project Bluefin O.S. I'm going to create a new Ubuntu container for this assignment.

I've selected Ubuntu 24.04, because I already have the image downloaded, and it is stable.

Here I've entered my container, and we can see that setup is successful. Let's enter it and get mariadb installed.
