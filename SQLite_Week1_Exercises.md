*This assignment is split into two parts: **RESEARCH** and **TODO**. I'm going to place the research at the end of this document, because I'll probably refer back to the TODO section more frequently.*

## TODO 
lorem


## Research

For research, I've been assigned to read the following: 

*E. F. Codd, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks,"
Comm. ACM, vol. 13, no. 6 (June 1970)*, pages 377-387

And 

*"SEQUEL: A Structured English Query Language"
Proceedings of the 1974 ACM SIGFIDET Workshop on Data Description, Access and Control.
Association for Computing Machinery:*, pages 249-264

From these readings, I'll pull key phrases/words and definitions.

### A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks 

**Data Bank:** Broader term structured repository of data, term contains Relational Data Base

**Data Base:** Organized collection of structured data. 

**Data Structure:** Format for organizing and storing data.

**Data Organization:** The process of collecting, structuring, and storing data.

**Hierarchies of Data:** Organizational Structure of data elements arranged in a hierarchical order or tree. Parent/child setup.

**Networks of Data:** More flexible way to organize data, where hierarchical is stricter. Allows for individual data to have more than one parent/child. 

**Relations:** Description of connections/interactions between SQL tables.

**Derivability:** Certain data, tables, etc. can be derived from other data, rather than being physically stored in the database.

**Redundancy:** Storing data in multiple places. Can be bad (duplicate entries) or good (backups)

**Consistency:** Ensuring all changes to a database follow the rules and constraints specified. 

**Composition:** A strong dependency between two tables (such as a parent/child).

**JOIN:** Used to combine rows from multiple tables based off a related column.

**Retrieval Language:** Fetch data from a database without modifying data (SELECT)

**Predicate Calculus:** Defining and filtering data based on logical conditions. Specifies WHAT vs HOW to retrieve.

**Security:** Protect a database from unauthorized access or destruction.

**Data Integrity:** Ensuring the data in a database maintains it's intended state.



### *SEQUEL: A Structured English Query Language

**Query Languages:** A language used to fetch/modify data from a database

**DBMS (Data Base Management Systems):** Software used to create and manipulate databases.

**Information Retrieval:** Methods to pull data from database columns, such as utilizing regex.

**Data Manipulation Languages:** The subset of SQL that deals with altering data in a database *without* changing database structure.
