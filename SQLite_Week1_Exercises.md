*This assignment is split into two parts: **RESEARCH** and **TODO**.*
## Research

For research, I've been assigned to read the following: 

*E. F. Codd, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks,"
Comm. ACM, vol. 13, no. 6 (June 1970)*, pages 377-387

And 

*"SEQUEL: A Structured English Query Language"
Proceedings of the 1974 ACM SIGFIDET Workshop on Data Description, Access and Control.
Association for Computing Machinery:*, pages 249-264

From these readings, I'll pull key phrases/words and definitions.
